HELLO JUNGLE WORLD 

This is my first challenge on front-end development using HTML5 and CSS ! 

A challenge that brought me satisfaction with the final result and a lot of learning since I have no professional experience in the area (:

I hope I met at least the essential prerequisites but I know that, like everything in life, there is still a lot to improve !

NOTE: The resourses folder available for the challenge did not have the social media icons, so I took the liberty of including them in my images folder in this repository.
